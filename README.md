## Cloning the repository

The `git clone` command is a bit different for LoR_DDragon, because of the use of Git's submodules. In order to clone the repository, you will need to add an `--recursive` option in the command.

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/InFinity54/LoR_DDragon LoR_DDragon
```
