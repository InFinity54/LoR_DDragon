## Introduction
_Data Dragon_ is a package of files you can use for your projects about [_Legends of Runeterra_](https://playruneterra.com), distributed by Riot Games. A new version of Data Dragon is released some days after each new set release. This repository allows you to update automatically all files more easily.

Don't forget that new patchs will be added right after their release on Riot Games' Developers website, but it takes often many days to come.
